# Random-Password-Generator
This repo is about generating a random password for the user. This challange is about a webpage that uses Javascript, HTML and CSS to generate a random password. it askes the user a few questions and on the passes of those questions it produces the password. The html and CSS code is given in the starter code to make the page work but the real magic is in the inspect element -> console which is ammended by javascript.

My motivation for this project is to make sure the I have learned the stuff taugh in the lessons. To make this project a stepping stone on my journy to a frontend developer.  I build this project because I wanted to test what the knowledge that I gained from the bootcamp and apply it to a real world example.

It solves problems of generating a random password that would be extreamly hard to crack

I learned how to use different functions, methods etc of Javascript.
